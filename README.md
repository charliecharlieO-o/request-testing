# Request Samples

In this repo I test 3 different ways to make requests,, the first is just a simple API gget request with the *request-promise* library, the second one is using the allegedly faster *req-fast* library and the last benchmark is a web scraping request using *cheerio* to process the HTML body.

## Usage

This is for running the benchmark
```javascript
// Fetch the repo
npm install
npm test
```

This is for using the actual function
 - npm install request-promise
 - copy index.js to your code and rename it to whatever you wish
 - import index.js
 - use the function apiRequest(YOUR-URL-HERE) as you please

*NOTE: the function returns a promise which means you can use it inside an async function*

## index.js

Index file contains a request function implemented with promises and https support and exports it.

## example.js

This file is the final implementation of the promisified functions and simple benchmarking script, it uses asynchronous functions in order to keep everything niceand ES6 compliant.
